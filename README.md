**`Junior Developer (Developer/3D Artist/Gamer)`**


I’m an engineer who enjoys working across C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I build things ranging from web apps to WebGL games, and I like exploring both frontend polish and backend logic.  
Sometimes I dive into frameworks like Spring, other times I keep it simple and lightweight.  
Outside of projects, I tend to experiment, ask odd “what if” questions, and chase down bugs until they behave.
